# Smart Accident Alert System

> Introduction

Due to increasing number of vehicles on road, accidents are also increasing, and consequently there have been sharp increase in mortalities caused due to road traffic injury.

Smart Accident Alert System tries curb accidents. It is Accident detection and messaging system using GPS and GSM,in which the accelerometer is used as an input to the system and corresponding response is analyzed by Arduino. If an accident occurs then SMS is send to registered mobile number so that immediate help can be provided.


> Novelty of the System

Driver will be intimated about ‘accident prone zone’ based in the vicinity of vehicle's coordinate. Hence , the driver will become cautious while driving. 

An extra module - Camera - is included for further enhancement of the Accident Alert System,
which will take picture of the driver in regular intervals and send to a server via wi-fi. This will help
in jugding the behaviour of the driver while driving.
